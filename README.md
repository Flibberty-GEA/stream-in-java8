### Thinking in Streams (Java 8)

There are code examples for the article about the <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html">Stream</a> in Java 8.

The main goal of the article is to ensure understanding of a functional programming with the Stream. 
Java 8 provides a functional programming, which is much different from a previous code style, 
and at the same time, it is similar to the style which is used in functional languages such as Scala, 
or in declarative languages like SQL. The article contains some analogies and examples of code, 
that demonstrate what the Stream is, how to use it and not to shoot yourself in the foot.
